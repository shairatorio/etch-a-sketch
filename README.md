## Overview

The Etch A Sketch app that allows users to draw and sketch using a cursor controlled by the mouse. The application is inspired by the classic children's toy, but instead of using arrow keys, the user controls the cursor using the mouse pointer.

## Feature

* **Color Picker Button** - This feature allows users to choose from a variety of different colors to draw with. By clicking on the color picker button, users can access a color palette and select their desired color to draw with.

* **Rainbow Button** - This feature is a fun feature that allows users to draw with a rainbow of colors. When the rainbow button is clicked, the drawing tool will cycle through the colors of the rainbow as the user draws.

* **Erase Button** - This feature allows users to undo their last stroke or erase the entire drawing area. This feature is especially useful for fixing mistakes or starting over on a new drawing.

* **Clear Button** - This feature resets the drawing area to its original state. This allows users to start again and create new drawings without having to reload the page. This feature is useful for users who want to create multiple drawings without having to refresh the page each time.

* **Slider Button** - This feature adjusts the size of the grid on the drawing area. By moving the slider button up or down, users can create a larger or smaller grid for their drawing. This feature is useful for creating different levels of detail in the user's drawing, depending on the size of the grid.

## Tools
* Visual Studio Code
* Gitbash terminal
* Git and GitHub
